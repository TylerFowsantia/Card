# CardGame
I decided to create a blackjack card game, with a simplified AI and card system.
This helped me learn how to use dictionaries and experiement with my coding knowledge of Tkinter and Python
Taking ~250 lines of code, over the course of ~2 weeks. I completed it.
Creating a backdrop along with my win, tie, and lose screens using MS Paint, I feel accomplished.
I found all of my card assets after a quick google search for a pack of cards.
